<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amiral Router</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
I started my career in the software industry many years ago and have gained a wide range of advanced experience in this field during this time. I have played an active role in projects in many different areas and have made significant contributions to the development of various projects. I had the opportunity to gain a lot of experience in different aspects of the software world.

During my working life, I gained the ability to use many software languages effectively. From basic languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, to newer and more original languages such as Swift, Kotlin, Go, and Rust, I have reached a level of expertise in a wide range. I was able to develop efficient and powerful software solutions by combining these languages in a way that suits the needs of the projects.

In addition, I can successfully use popular and widely used frameworks used in many projects. I have reached a deep level of expertise in frameworks such as Django, React, Angular, Spring, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and ASP.NET. This allows me to speed up the development processes of projects and create more reliable and scalable software.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in software projects for different sectors and have thus made significant contributions in various sectors. In the financial sector, I have developed software that manages complex financial transactions, helping customers to provide reliable and fast services. In the healthcare sector, I have contributed to people's health by designing software that facilitates the processing of medical data and provides effective communication between healthcare organizations. In the education sector, I have helped to improve the quality of education by developing various learning platforms that support students and teachers in their educational processes.

In addition, I have successfully worked in the industrial automation, telecommunications, e-commerce, and gaming industries. In the projects in these sectors, I developed software that meets the needs of the sector, meets customer expectations, and puts the user experience at the forefront.

All of these experiences and knowledge have developed my ability to manage complex projects and coordinate teamwork. At the same time, I closely followed technological trends and always took care to add value to my projects by using the latest tools and technologies.

In conclusion, I believe that I can successfully work on any type of software project with the deep experience and expertise that I have gained in the long-term career in the software industry. My goal is to continue to produce solutions that support technological transformation and benefit people with a philosophy of continuous learning and development.

In addition, I can develop Android mobile applications using Java and Kotlin languages on the Android platform, create user-friendly interfaces, and design efficient and fast-running applications.

In terms of web applications, I prefer Angular and AngularJS frameworks to develop interactive and scalable web projects that enrich the user experience. At the same time, I am also actively involved in the development of modern web and mobile applications with Vue.js, React and React Native.

In server-side development, I am proficient in writing fast, efficient and scalable server-side applications with Node.js and Express frameworks. I can also securely and effectively build web applications with Python-based frameworks such as Django and Flask. I have experience in creating dynamic web sites using CodeIgniter and Laravel in PHP-based projects.

In database management, I have expertise in data storage and processing using different database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and SQLite. I can also optimize data analysis and search operations with Elasticsearch.

In the field of mobile application development, I create cross-platform supported applications with Flutter and React Native. Flutter allows you to design visually impressive and performance-oriented mobile applications. Similarly, with React Native, I develop efficient applications using the same code base for both Android and iOS platforms.

In machine learning and artificial intelligence, I can create deep learning models with TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries using Python language. I can convert data into meaningful information by effectively using the pandas library in data analysis and manipulation.

In data visualization, I can create impressive graphics and visuals with libraries such as D3.js and Chart.js. This allows me to contribute to data-driven decision-making processes by presenting database-based analyses in an understandable way.
